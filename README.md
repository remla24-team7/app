# app

This is the repository for the app of Assigment 2. 

The frontend is in the frontend folder and the backend is in the backend folder. 

To run frontend, simply run index.html or open it on a browser. 

To run the backend, run app.py in the backend folder. 

Entering a URL and then clicking predict on the website while the backend is running, will query the backend which then communicates with the model-service to retrieve the prediciton. The prediciton is then shown on the website. Make sure to have model-service running for this backend to work.
